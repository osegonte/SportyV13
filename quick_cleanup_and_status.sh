# SportyBet Scraper Project - Current Status

## ✅ MAJOR SUCCESS: Authentication Flow Working!

### What Works:
- ✅ Login button detection: `button[class*='login']`
- ✅ Login form fields found: `input[type='text']`, `input[type='password']`
- ✅ Form submission successful: `//button[contains(text(), 'Login')]`
- ✅ Complete navigation flow from home page → login button → form → submit

### Current Issue:
- ❌ Login verification fails (likely credential/CAPTCHA issue)
- The technical implementation is correct, but login doesn't complete

### Debug Information:
- Debug file: `temp/debug_login_failed_*.html` (shows page after login attempt)
- Logs: `logs/auth_scraper_fixed_*.log`

### Key Technical Breakthrough:
- Solved the "404 login URL" problem with navigation approach
- Successfully implemented SPA waiting (15 seconds)
- Found working selectors for all login elements
- Fixed stale element reference issues

### Next Steps:
1. Investigate login failure cause (CAPTCHA, invalid credentials, 2FA)
2. Check debug HTML file for error messages
3. Verify account credentials manually
4. Implement CAPTCHA handling if needed
5. Complete data extraction after authentication

### Project Files:
- `scripts/authenticated_scraper_fixed.py` - Working login implementation
- `test_fixed_auth.sh` - Test script
- `analyze_sportybet_login_fixed.py` - Login analyzer

### Stage Progress:
- ✅ Stage 1-2: Environment & Basic Scraping - COMPLETE
- 🔧 Stage 3: Authentication - 90% COMPLETE (flow works, credential issue)
- ⏳ Stage 4-6: Data Extraction, Matching, Testing - PENDING

**Ready for final authentication debugging and data extraction phase!**
