echo "   ‚Ä¢ SportyBet loads content dynamically with JavaScript"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Static HTML only contains <div id='app'> loading screen"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Current selectors fail because they run before form loads"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Need Selenium with WebDriverWait for dynamic content"

echo "üí° SOLUTION APPROACHES:"

echo "1. ü§ñ SELENIUM WITH PROPER WAITS (Recommended)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Use WebDriverWait with Expected Conditions"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Wait 10-15 seconds for JavaScript to render form"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Look for React/Vue component selectors"
